# Secret Journal Access – Public Demo

Welcome to the **Public Demo** of the Secret Journal Access project.  
This is a puzzle-based gate featuring AI-generated historical images and a hidden target revealed only after solving the sequence.

## 🧠 What It Is

This project presents users with a visual memory puzzle: select four AI-generated historical images in the correct chronological order. If successful, you're granted access to a hidden destination — without ever seeing the real URL.

In this public demo, the target is **mirrored** inside the app using a serverless function, so it appears seamlessly within the site.

## 🔍 Features

- 🎨 **AI-Generated Historical Images**  
  A set of 10 images representing historical milestones — visually rich, generated by AI for an immersive experience.

- 🧩 **Chronological Puzzle Gate**  
  A 4-image memory challenge that asks the user to click through historical events in the correct timeline order.

- 🔐 **Hidden Destination via Mirroring**  
  On success, users are shown a mirrored external page (e.g., a GitHub repo) using a Netlify Function proxy — the actual target URL is never revealed to the user.

- 🔁 **New Puzzle on Refresh**  
  Each refresh gives you a new random 4-image sequence to solve.

> 🔎 The `resource/` folder exists only to help reviewers understand the logic. It is **not deployed** publicly and does not affect the live application.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Images are encrypted using AES-GCM with randomized filenames.
2. The frontend fetches and decrypts `.enc` files in the browser using Web Crypto.
3. A Netlify function provides the correct chronological index for the selected images.
4. Upon successful sequence input, the app shows a **mirrored version** of a hidden target (like a GitHub repo) using a proxy function.

## 🔗 Demo Target

In this public demo, the final destination is:

```
https://github.com/rz74/rzwebsite
```

…but you’ll never see that in the browser address bar. It’s mirrored inside the app using a Netlify Function proxy, so users stay within the site visually.

## 🤝 License & Collaboration

This project is **not open source — yet**. I'm actively working on it and exploring the best way to share it more broadly in the future.

You're welcome to explore the public demo and learn from it, but please **do not copy, reuse, or redistribute** the code, images, or concepts without permission.

🚀 That said, I'm totally open to collaboration!
