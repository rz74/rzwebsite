# Secret Journal Access – Public Demo

Welcome to the **Public Demo** of the Secret Journal Access project. This is a puzzle-based gate featuring AI-generated historical images and a hidden target revealed only after solving the sequence.

## 🧠 What It Is

This project presents users with a visual memory puzzle: select four AI-generated historical images in the correct chronological order. If successful, you're granted access to a hidden destination — without ever seeing the real URL.

In this public demo, that target is **mirrored** inside the app, so you never leave the site.

## 🔍 Features

- 🎨 **AI-Generated Historical Images**  
  A set of 10 images representing historical milestones — visually rich, generated by AI for an immersive experience.

- 🧩 **Chronological Puzzle Gate**  
  A 4-image memory challenge that asks the user to click through historical events in the correct timeline order.

- 🔐 **Hidden Destination via Mirroring**  
  On success, users are shown a mirrored external page (e.g., a GitHub repo) using a Netlify Function proxy — the actual target URL is never revealed.

- 🔁 **New Puzzle on Refresh**  
  Each refresh gives you a new random 4-image sequence to solve.

## 🛠 How It Works

1. **A client-side script** fetches encrypted `.enc` image files from `/encrypted/` and decrypts them using AES-GCM in the browser.
2. The correct image order is determined by a hidden index map served via a Netlify function.
3. The images are obfuscated using random filenames, and only the logic knows how to match them.
4. If the player succeeds, a mirrored version of the target page is rendered via `/functions/mirror-github`.

## 🔗 Demo Target

In this public branch, the target page is

this repo.

…but you'll never see that directly. Instead, it's mirrored within the app using a serverless function and iframe to keep it visually seamless.

## 🤝 License & Collaboration

This project is **not open source — yet**. I'm actively working on it and exploring the best way to share it more broadly in the future.

You're welcome to explore the public demo and learn from it, but please **do not copy, reuse, or redistribute** the code, images, or concepts without permission.

🚀 That said, I'm totally open to collaboration!
